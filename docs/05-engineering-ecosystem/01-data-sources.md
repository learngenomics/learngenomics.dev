# Data Sources

One of the more challenging aspects of working with genomics data can be finding real
data to get your hands on. This page serves as a directory of places where one can
access both open access and protected access (requires an application) data. Please be
aware that many sites offer both open access and controlled access data, so they will
show up in both lists in that case.

:::caution
This list is by no means complete! New data sources are being added all of the time, and
we have only added a few data sources to start this page off. Please make a pull request
with data sources you are aware of so we can incorporate them.
