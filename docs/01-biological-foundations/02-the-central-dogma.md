# The Central Dogma 

## Introduction

Essential to understanding the biology driving computational genomics analyses is an
understanding of the "Central Dogma of Molecular Biology". The [Wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology) for the Central
Dogma is incredibly detailed. However, an overview and a simplified figure depict the
process below.

The key takeaways for our purposes are as follows:

1.  The complete information for replicating cells is preserved in DNA, which holds the
    instructions for creating proteins spread across the chromosomes.

2.  Before a cell produces a protein, the portion of DNA that encodes the protein is
    used as a template to create Ribonucleic Acid (or **RNA**) molecules through a
    process known as **transcription**. RNA is a temporary working copy of instructions,
    or a **transcript**.

3.  Through the process of **translation**, the instructions in the RNA transcript are
    read and decoded to assemble a specific protein byproduct.

## The Bakery Revisited

Let's continue to build upon our bakery analogy. In the previous chapter, we covered
that DNA represents the complete recipe book for our bakery. In practice, this recipe
book is kept locked away in the back office of the bakery (the nucleus of a cell). Only
a few special staff members are allowed to go into the back office and read from the
master recipe book. Rather than take the entire book out of the office when they leave,
these staff members _transcribe_ a copy of a particular recipe on a piece of paper
(analogous to RNA transcripts). These working copies of the the recipe are then carried
out of the back office are given to the baking staff on the baking floor. Last, the
baking staff uses these working copies to bake any number of physical cakes (analogous
to proteins). Eventually, the working copies of the recipes are worn out and degrade,
rendering them unable to be used by the baking staff. 

A few important points as we expand our understanding: 

- First, as stated earlier, there are only a finite number of the master recipes locked
  away (generally two, in the case of humans). However, there can be many, many working
  copies of the recipes floating around the bakery. Clearly, if more working copies of
  the recipe are floating around on the bakery floor, more cooks can work on that recipe
  at the same time, and more physical cakes of that type can be made. 
- Next, occasionally mistakes are made in either the transcription or translation
  processes. These can be transient, and cells have built in failsafe mechanisms to
  identify and neutralize the effects of these mistakes. However, these mistakes can
  become the cornerstone for disease. As you can imagine, the further upstream in this
  process a mistake occurs (and especially if a mistake is persisted in the master
  recipe book), the higher the potential damage it can cause.
