The DNA sequences of all the genes in a genome is known as a **genotype**. The observed trait that specific genes confer is known as a **phenotype**. When we see a person with blue eyes (a phenotype), we know that they carry a set specific genetic sequences that makes that eye color possible (a genotype). In cancer, the features of the disease are the phenotype and the mutations and variants make up the genotype. In genomics, analysts seek to link genotypes to phenotypes to improve diagnoses and understand how cancer works.

Recall that each human genome is composed of pairs of chromosomes, one inherited from each parent. That means, with a few exceptions, nearly every gene has two copies. Often the two DNA sequences of that encoded gene differ. Each distinct copy is a **haplotype** for that gene. Together the two haplotypes make up the genotype, and the proteins they produce determines the phenotype. A variant is often detected on only one copy of the gene. If the variant causes a loss of function in an important gene, that one mutation may be insufficient to cause cancer but may create a predisposition to cancer later in life.
