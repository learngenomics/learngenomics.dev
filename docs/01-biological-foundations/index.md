We'll start with the biological foundations relevant to **genomics**, which is the study
of the structure and function of genomes. Only with high-quality, scalable toolsets
written with contributed expertise from both computer scientists and biologists is
analysis of the billions of bases that make up genomes tractable. The biological
concepts are complex, but the they can be summarized in general processes that are
easier to understand. Further, the methods for measuring and analyzing genomes have
matured and can be distilled to key features which we will cover here.

Everything in this guide refers to eukaryotic molecular biology, which is the study of
organisms whose DNA is enclosed within a nucleus. Broadly speaking, most familiar
species are eukaryotes, except bacteria which has DNA spread throughout the cell. At
times, this document will be geared towards the sequencing of human cells specifically.
