We'll start with the biological foundations relevant to **genomics**, which is the study
of the structure and function of genomes. Only with efficient computational methods is
analysis of the billions of bases that make up genomes tractable. Like any computational
method, genomic applications are most effective when they incorporate a basic
understanding of how genomes function. The topic is complex, but the biology of genomics
can be summarized in general processes. Further, the methods for measuring and analyzing
genomes have matured and can be distilled to key features which we will cover here.

Everything in this guide refers to eukaryotic molecular biology, which is the study of
organisms whose DNA is enclosed within a nucleus. Broadly speaking, most familiar
species are eukaryotes, except bacteria which has DNA spread throughout the cell. At
times, this document will be geared towards the sequencing of human cells specifically.
