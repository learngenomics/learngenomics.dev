# Foreword

After graduating with a degree in Computer Science, I took a job as a Software Engineer working in the exciting world of genomic data analysis. The goal is simple but powerful: identify what has changed in an individual's DNA and to understand how those changes relate to outwardly, phenotypic changes (such as developing cancer). As a software engineer, I was trained to take my computational knowledge and apply it to any number of domains. For the domains I had worked in during the past, I found it relatively easy to find training materials geared towards Computer Scientists that are new to that particular domain; I was surprised to find that material was incredibly hard to find in the case of genomics.
‌

Five years later, this problem remains. In fact, every new engineering hire on my team sits down with me for an hour and a half during their first week to receive a crash course in Computational Genomics because there is still no sufficient reference material available. In speaking with others in the community, I think that this gap of knowledge is not localized to only my team or organization: this roadblock remains one of the (if not the) largest barriers to data scientists and computer engineers applying their collective knowledge to push the field forward. In an effort to remove this barrier, my original lecture series—with heavy edits from friends in the community—have been published here. Our hope is that this guide will turn into a community-driven project that aids new software engineers in learning this fascinating domain.

What follows is a guide to getting started in computational genomics that is written and maintained by the engineering community. This content has been reviewed by both expert biologists and seasoned software engineers in the field to ensure the information is accurate. Our goal is to enable the data scientists and software engineers of the world to build a solid foundational knowledge of genomics and make an impact on the field.

_Disclaimer: This guide is written specifically for computer scientists and engineers. The underlying biology in cancer genomics can be exceedingly complex in some parts which requires years of study. Making the content palatable requires drawing abstractions around these concepts. This guide should be treated as an introduction to the domain that introduces our audience to the material in a "broad-strokes" fashion. Please be forgiving if you feel we have glossed over your favorite quirk of cancer genomics. Further, everything within the guide is presented within a research context. If you feel anything has been stated incorrectly, you can file an issue on the Github repository._
