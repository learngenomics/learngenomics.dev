SNVs and Indels form the class of "small" genetic mutations which is frequently described as affecting anything from single base pairs up to around 10,000 base pairs. By contrast, SVs and CNVs are typically considered large genetic mutations that disrupt many genes and create gene fusions with novel cellular functions. A common type of SV is the CNV where one copy of chromosome or part of a chromosome may be duplicated or lost, substantially changing the prevalence of many proteins in the cell. Typically, large chromosomal changes that favor cancer progression develop in a tumor over time, altering the response to treatment, rate of growth and capacity to spread within the body.
