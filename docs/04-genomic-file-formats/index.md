# Genomic File Formats

When working with genomics data for the first time, many engineers are surprised to find that genomics file types are quite simple in structure. In fact, a majority of universal file formats such as [SAM/BAM](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf), [VCF](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf), [BED](https://uswest.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/bed.html), [GFF/GTF](https://uswest.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html) and many other custom formats are simply tab-delimited text files with some form of compression and/or serialization. Mastery of Unix command line tools such as grep, less, cut, join, sort, sed, and awk are essential to working effectively in this domain. We'll walk through the most common types of file formats in genomics, starting with an overview of BGZF and compression.
